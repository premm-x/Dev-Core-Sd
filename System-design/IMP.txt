----------------------- LLD --------------------------

To approach any LLD question in interviews:

1.    Understand requirements  →  clarify features & constraints.
2.    Identify core objects/classes  →  real-world entities.
3.    Define attributes & methods  →  what each class stores and does.
4.    Set relationships  →  inheritance, composition, associations.
5.    Apply design patterns if needed  →  singleton, factory, strategy.
6.    Handle edge cases & future extensions  →  full, empty, new features.



----------------------- HLD --------------------------

1. to approach any HLD question in interviews (like how to break down requirements → APIs → DB → scaling → security)? 
This is what interviewers expect instead of just random answers.
