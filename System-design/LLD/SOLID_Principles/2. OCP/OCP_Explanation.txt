2. OCP – Open/Closed Principle

Definition:
    A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    You should be able to add new behavior without changing existing code.

Common Violation Example:
    DiscountCalculator has multiple if-else checks for every discount type.
    Every time a new discount is added (e.g., FESTIVAL), you must modify the same class — violating OCP.

-- Before.java
-- After.java

Lesson:
    Adding a new discount (like FestivalDiscount) only needs a new class — no changes in existing logic.
    This keeps your system stable and easily extendable.
