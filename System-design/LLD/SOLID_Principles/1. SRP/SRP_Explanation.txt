1. SRP – Single Responsibility Principle

Definition:
    A class should have only one reason to change — one responsibility.

Common Violation Example:
    InvoicePrinter both calculates totals and prints invoices. Mixing logic and presentation.

-- Before.java
-- After.java

Lesson:
    Now Invoice handles data and logic, while InvoicePrinter handles presentation.
