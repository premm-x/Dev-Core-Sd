3. LSP – Liskov Substitution Principle

Definition:
    Subclasses should be replaceable by their base class without breaking the application’s behavior.

Common Violation Example:
    A subclass (Square) overrides behavior of its parent (Rectangle) in a way that changes expected results — 
    so substituting one for the other breaks the logic.

-- Before.java
-- After.java

Lesson:
    Square and Rectangle now follow a common Shape interface instead of inheritance that breaks behavior.
    All subclasses can substitute their base type safely.
